## Project Context

- **Project type:** existing
- **Stack summary:** Not yet detected

---

## Autonomy

- **Default Engine:** auto
- **YOLO Mode:** ENABLED
- **Git Autonomy:** ENABLED
- **GitHub Issues:** DISABLED


---

## Execution Model

### Phase 1: Prepare

- Build deep understanding with recursive planning and critique.
- Research each major component using reputable sources when available.
- Produce specs, research docs, and implementation plan.
- Track confidence and ask humans only for critical clarification.

### Phase 2: Build

- Requires plan + specs + research artifacts.
- Runs consensus checks before entering autonomous build loops.
- Implements one scoped item at a time and verifies before completion.

## Completion Signal

Only output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when the current mode's acceptance criteria are met:
1. **Prepare/Plan:** required artifacts are written, coherent, and pass readiness checks.
2. **Build:** requirements are implemented, tests/lint pass (or blockers are documented), and git actions are complete when autonomy is enabled.

Never output the completion signal early.
